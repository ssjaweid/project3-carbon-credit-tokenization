# project3-carbon-credit-tokenization

## Project Overview

Create a streamlit application to allow users to tokenize and transact carbon credits. 

We will allow users to input certain activities with the carbon offset value of those activities and then ask them to tokenize the carbon offset into a token. 

Users will be able to convert these credits using the ERC-20 format so they can be fungible allowing for trading and transacting.

Users should be able to swap the token to an Eth or Wei value.

## Technical Stack

Solidity for the smart contract development - based on ERC-20 type contracts.

Streamlit for developing the Front End UI using Python.

Use W3 package for blockchain functions and transactions. Use math for calculations. Use requests library for making simple http requests.
